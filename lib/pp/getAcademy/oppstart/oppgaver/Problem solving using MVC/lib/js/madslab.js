            Once upon a time ${total} ${hero} lived in a valley, all named "${name}."
            There is very little grass in the valley, so they must cross a river
            to get to "s√¶ter" (a mountain pasture) to graze and fatten themselves
            up. But under the bridge lives a a fearsome and hideous ${villian} who eats everyone who tries to cross.

            The smallest ${hero} first. The ${villian} stops him and threatens to "gobble him up!" The
            little ${hero} tells the ${villian} he should wait for his big brother to cross, because he is
            larger and would make for a more gratifying feast. The greedy troll agrees and lets
            the smallest ${hero} pass.
            
            Then the medium-sized ${hero} approaches the bridge. He is more cautious than his brother,
            but the ${villian} stops him too. The second ${hero} convinces the ${villian} to wait for their eldest
            brother, the largest of the three, and the ${hero} lets him pass as well.
            
            Then the largest ${hero} steps on to the bridge and meets the ${villian} waiting to devour him.
            The largest ${hero} challenges him to fight and then throws him into the water with his horns.
            The ${villian} drowns in the stream, and from then on the bridge is safe. The three ${hero}s go to eat
            in the rich fields around the summer farm in the hills, and live happily ever after. </div>
