            My interest in coding began in my teens, 
            and I joined a coding community to expand
            my knowledge. I learned the fundamentals
            of HTML and CSS, but JavaScript was a
            bit beyond my grasp at the time. As
            an adult, I decided to revisit programming
            and have been focusing on back-end
            development with Python and database
            management. It's been a great learning experience.
